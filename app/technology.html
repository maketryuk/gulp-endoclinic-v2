The result                is a three-dimensional movement that triggers cavitation – a process by which                bubbles formed from the action of the polyamide tip become unstable,                collapse, and cause a vacuum-like ‘implosion.’                This creates a micro cyclone inside the root canal, and thanks to this incredible                technological advancement we can now clean canals with much higher levels of                accuracy than ever before.              </p>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <div class="technology__wrapper secondary">        <div class="technology-card">          <div class="technology-card__image">            <picture><source srcset="img/technology/technology-5.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/technology/technology-5.png" alt="Technology preview"></picture>          </div>          <div class="technology-card__content">            <div class="technology-card__header">              <h3 class="technology-card__title">Microscope and Orascoptic loupes</h3>            </div>            <div class="technology-card__body">              <p class="site-description">                It is often said in medicine that if you cannot see it, you cannot treat it. We can                find root canals narrower than a human hair with our advanced magnification                systems – and that means we can treat them, too.                At The Endodontic Clinic, we use both dental loupe and microscope                magnification. Orascoptic loupes are the leading source of magnification for                endodontic practitioners: the XV1 model that we use has the option of x3, x4                and x5 magnification and its Konica lens provides crystal clear vision that makes                it well-suited to root canal treatments, crown preparation and endodontic                diagnostics.              </p>              <p class="site-description">                Our preferred microscope is the extremely sophisticated Carl Zeiss microscope                – widely recognised as the finest instrument of its type and very much a key                component in the treatments that we undertake at The Endodontic Clinic. The                same microscope is also used in micro-vascular and neurosurgery, and without                it, complex root canal treatment delivered at the highest levels would not be                possible. The intensity of its Xenon light is brighter than looking into the sun.                The right combination of loupes and the endodontic microscope gives us the                ability to refine the level of precision involved in the ever demanding and                technical field of root canal therapy, and deliver world-class results.              </p>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <div class="technology__wrapper secondary">        <div class="technology-card">          <div class="technology-card__image">            <picture><source srcset="img/technology/technology-6.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/technology/technology-6.png" alt="Technology preview"></picture>          </div>          <div class="technology-card__content">            <div class="technology-card__header">              <h3 class="technology-card__title">3D Computer Guided Endodontics</h3>            </div>            <div class="technology-card__body">              <p class="site-description">                Pulp cells – soft tissue comprised of blood vessels, neural fibers and connective                tissue in the root of the tooth – continue to create dentin (the fabric of the                tooth beneath the exterior enamel) over time. In some cases, this can result in                root canals becoming constricted.When this happens, a new revolutionary technique can be used to locate the                most inaccessible canals and treat them. Canals that open up in the deepest                sections of the root canal system can be located using a computer-guided root                canal therapy process which makes it possible to view the overall anatomy of                the jaw, teeth, root canal system and surrounding tissues. This helps us to                know exactly where the root canals are located before starting treatment.                                              </p>              <p class="site-description">                The step-by-step process of root canal therapy using the computer-guided                workflow is as follows:              </p>              <p class="site-description">                Overall scan of the jaw area: with the help of the most sophisticated                CBCT scanner, we are able to generate an accurate three-dimensional                image of the jaw area including the exact teeth positions, dental                restorations, shape and location of the root canal system, bone quality                and quantity, nerve tissues and any sinus cavities.              </p>              <p class="site-description">                Creation of 3D model: once we have this detailed information, with the                help of highly specialised software we are able to create a 3D model of                the jaw so we can ‘virtually’ gain access to the root canal system through                the optimum pathway.              </p>              <p class="site-description">                Drilling guide is prepared: The 3D model showing the virtual placement                and correct angulation of the drill is then sent to a specialised laboratory                to prepare the precise drilling guide using 3D printing.
