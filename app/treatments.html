            <p>                  During the procedure, the pulp (tooth nerve) is removed from inside the tooth, and the area it vacates is then meticulously cleaned and sealed.

There are other instances in which a second opinion report may be                  required, as detailed below.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Who is it for?</h4>                <p>                  Any individual who is worried about the level of care they are getting from                  their existing dentist, or who has just completed an expensive or complicated                  treatment elsewhere and is unhappy with the end result.                  Our second opinion reports can also be of benefit to those who are worried                  about a hospital or NHS referral that is taking too long; people who have had                  an accident and need to make a claim; those who need a dental report because                  of their job (for example, if they are working overseas for an extended period);                  and those who are simply 'shopping around' and want to get an idea of what a                  detailed treatment plan would look like and cost.                  Another reason someone might want to seek a second opinion is if they have                  been told by their dentist that they need to see a dental specialist in a specific                  field; the Endodontic Clinic team will be able to advise the best course of                  action.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>How does it work?</h4>                <p>                  Our second opinion reports involve a full dental examination, oral and tongue                  cancer screening, full charting of the teeth (including Periodontal charting),                  small X-rays, a large extra-oral x-ray, a suggested written treatment plan (which                  can be taken to other dentists) and a copy of all of the patient’s notes, X-rays                  and signed paperwork.                </p>                <p>                  The report is designed to offer patients all the information they need to take                  the next step – whatever they choose that to be.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  Normally, not at all – though if someone comes to see us with a toothache                  there might be some minor additional discomfort while we examine the mouth                  in order to evaluate the situation.                                  </p>              </li>            </ul>            <div class="treatments-content__image">              <picture><source srcset="img/treatments/treatments-2.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/treatments/treatments-2.png" alt="Treatments preview"></picture>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <div class="treatments__wrapper tabs__item">        <div class="treatments-content">          <div class="treatments-content__header">            <div class="treatments-content__header-wrapper">              <h3>CBCT scan</h3>              <span>Price: from <strong>£175</strong></span>            </div>            <a href="#" class="btn-primary">              <span>Enquire now</span>            </a>          </div>          <div class="treatments-content__body">            <ul>              <li>                <h4>What is it?</h4>                <p>                  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) scans are a way for a dentist to get a vivid 3D image of                  the intricacies of a patient’s teeth and gums without having to undertake                  exploratory/invasive treatment procedures to try and ascertain what lies                  “beneath the surface”.                </p>                <p>                  They are a state-of-the-art alternative to more traditional intra-oral x-rays,                  which show a two-dimensional image as opposed to the three-dimensional                  image created by a CBCT scan.                                  </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Who is it for?</h4>                <p>                  A CBCT scan is an excellent, state-of-the art diagnostic tool that is well-suited to                  patients whose dental issue is not clear-cut. Much of what happens to a tooth                  is going on beneath the surface, and while skilled experts can often                  hypothesize with a great degree of skill about a patient’s dental issue, a CBCT                  scan removes all of the guesswork. CBCT scans are very often used during                  endodontics to ensure that root canal treatment is indeed required.                                  </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>How does it work?</h4>                <p>                  The team at The Endodontic Clinic are highly proficient in this relatively new                  way of diagnosing dental conditions, and are able to pinpoint the scan down to                  a very specific part of the mouth – thus limiting radiation to an incredibly small                  area.                                  </p>                <p>                  The CBCT machine is similar to the CT scanner seen in hospitals, only much                  more compact. The 3D image it creates provides vital insight into the insides of                  the tooth and the area surrounding it, and can help identify tiny fractures,                  missed canal anatomy, diseases of the jaw and more.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  There is not normally any pain associated with a CBCT can at all.

Did you know that almost                  22 per cent of people skip their dental appointments because of fear?                  Thankfully, modern dentistry provides the answer in the form of IV sedation                  dentistry, which offers patients the chance to greatly reduce the stress that                  they may otherwise fear. It is a form of conscious sedation that does not put                  you fully to sleep, but it does make you relaxed and much less aware of your                  surroundings. It is also noted for its pain-reduction qualities, too.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Who is it for?</h4>                <p>                  Sedation can be a godsend for people in need of restorative dental work who                  have been avoiding making an appointment because they fear the dentist. It                  provides a way for a patient to become far less aware of – and concerned by –                  their surroundings while treatment is being undertaken.                  It is fast-acting, and, when coupled with local anaesthetic, ensures that as little                  discomfort as possible is experienced during the procedure.                                                   </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>How does it work?</h4>                <p>                  IV sedation is not readily available at all dental clinics and requires dedicated                  sedationists who have extensive clinical experience in the treatment of anxious                  patients. Those who work with The Endodontic Clinic are highly skilled and will                  hand-hold patients through every step of their treatment.                                            </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  No, though there will be a small pin-prick when the IV needle is applied. What                  may be very appealing to some is that dental sedation creates a period of                  amnesia, so you won't remember the procedure when you wake up.                  It can also be beneficial when multiple procedures are needed: when patients                  are relaxed and not experiencing any discomfort, they are more easily able to                  sit for longer spells in the dentist's chair, with the result that several visits may                  be condensed into one.                </p>              </li>            </ul>            <div class="treatments-content__image">              <picture><source srcset="img/treatments/treatments-2.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/treatments/treatments-2.png" alt="Treatments preview"></picture>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <div class="treatments__wrapper tabs__item">        <div class="treatments-content">          <div class="treatments-content__header">            <div class="treatments-content__header-wrapper">              <h3>Metal-free crowns</h3>              <span>Price: from <strong>£1,250</strong></span>            </div>            <a href="#" class="btn-primary">              <span>Enquire now</span>            </a>          </div>          <div class="treatments-content__body">            <ul>              <li>                <h4>What is it?</h4>                <p>                  Unlike metal crowns of the past, the all-ceramic crowns used by The                  Endodontic Clinic are crafted using layers of porcelain that not only protect the                  remaining tooth structure, but look more realistic than past restorations.                  Metal-free crowns are the premium option for restoring a damaged tooth.                                  </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Who is it for?</h4>                <p>                  Metal-free crowns are the most desirable solution for people who are looking                  for the most aesthetically-pleasing solution to a damaged tooth. Patients may                  either be referred to us by their dentist, or can contact us directly if they know                  they need a crown and would like to enjoy the unrivalled level of service and                  expertise that The Endodontic Clinic offers.

Technology                  has moved on somewhat since the 1970s and 80s when metal fillings were                  widely used; today's dentist has other options, and The Endodontic Clinic only                  fits white composite fillings, not least because these are aesthetically-pleasing.                             </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Who is it for?</h4>                <p>                  White composite fillings are a solution to tooth decay and cavities for patients                  of all ages. The quality of the filling material is second to none and is long-                  lasting, hard-wearing and virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the tooth.                                                                                 </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>How does it work?</h4>                <p>                  With the affected area having first been treated with anaesthetic to numb it,                  we next use a diamond-coated drill to remove the decayed area. At The                  Endodontic Clinic, we have many years of experience in extracting the decayed                  tissue from teeth and will painstakingly ensure that all the affected area – and                  no more – is removed.                           </p>                <p>                  The space left behind is then prepared for filling by thoroughly cleansing the                  cavity to ensure no debris or bacteria remains, before a composite resin in a                  hue designed to match the existing tooth is added. The final step is to polish                  the filling.                                                    </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  Fillings perhaps represent the stereotypical 'worst nightmare' in terms of a visit                  to the dentists, often because of unpleasant experiences people had of having                  fillings when they were a child.                  Fortunately, today's technology both in terms of anaesthetics and methods for                  the removal of decayed material render these historic impressions something                  of a myth.

Once the tooth heals, a                  new crown or other restoration is placed on the tooth to protect it.                                               </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  The level of discomfort is typically on a par with regular root canal treatment –                  and can, therefore, be minimised with expert care and local anaesthetic                  applied to the tooth in question.

At The Endodontic Clinic, we use bioceramic                  materials (BC RRM putty) for this, because clinical research has shown very                  high success rates when this material is used as a protective agent against the                  remaining exposed pulp.                                                 </p>                <p>                  There are two different clinical practice types when it comes to vital pulp                  therapy – both involve pulp capping, which is a restorative procedure used to                  prevent exposed pulp from dying.                                                             </p>                <p>                  As with all of our treatments, we are happy to explain the two options –                  indirect pulp capping and direct pulp capping – to patients who are interested                  in this type of treatment or for whom our examination has indicated that this is                  the best course of action.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  Ensuring patient comfort is a key aim at The Endodontic Clinic, which is why we                  administer anaesthetic in order to numb the area surrounding whichever tooth                  or teeth we are working on.                </p>                <p>                  Additionally, patients who are especially anxious at the thought of undergoing                  a dental procedure can talk to us about optional sedation, which some patients                  say helps enormously.                </p>              </li>            </ul>            <div class="treatments-content__image">              <picture><source srcset="img/treatments/treatments-2.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/treatments/treatments-2.png" alt="Treatments preview"></picture>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <div class="treatments__wrapper tabs__item">        <div class="treatments-content">          <div class="treatments-content__header">            <div class="treatments-content__header-wrapper">              <h3>Regenerative endodontic procedures</h3>              <span>Price: from <strong>£1,650</strong></span>            </div>            <a href="#" class="btn-primary">              <span>Enquire now</span>            </a>          </div>          <div class="treatments-content__body">            <ul>              <li>                <h4>What is it?</h4>                <p>                  Regenerative endodontics is an emerging field in which Dr El Jabouri at The                  Endodontic Clinic is something of a pioneer. In simple terms, it allows us to try                  and revitalise or regenerate an immature tooth's natural tissue so that the root                  can continue to grow.                        </p>                <p>                  This is in contrast to the more traditional option in instances of a tooth with                  root damage, which would be to harden the root end and close the canal.                  While this solves the issue, it does mean that the tooth's root will not continue                  to develop.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Who is it for?</h4>                <p>                  Younger people suffering damage to the root of a tooth who not only want to                  save the tooth but are keen for it to continue to develop (and harden), too.                                                                                               </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>How does it work?</h4>                <p>                  Regenerative endodontics uses the concept of tissue engineering to restore the                  pulp and root canals to a healthy state. Though tissue regeneration is still in its                  infancy, studies suggest that “dead,” immature teeth are capable of                  regenerating pulp-like tissues that foster root development.                  More information on the subject from the American Association of                  Endodontists can be found here:                  <a href="http://www.aae.org/uploadedfiles/publications_and_research/newsletters/endodontics_colleagues_for_excellence_newsletter/ecfespring2013.pdf">                    http://www.aae.org/uploadedfiles/publications_and_research/newsletters/en                    dodontics_colleagues_for_excellence_newsletter/ecfespring2013.pdf                  </a>                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  The treatment is similar to root canal therapy and we can give local                  anaesthetic. The tissue regeneration itself actually occurs after the treatment                  has been completed.                </p>              </li>            </ul>            <div class="treatments-content__image">              <picture><source srcset="img/treatments/treatments-2.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/treatments/treatments-2.png" alt="Treatments preview"></picture>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <div class="treatments__wrapper tabs__item">        <div class="treatments-content">          <div class="treatments-content__header">            <div class="treatments-content__header-wrapper">              <h3>Internal bleaching</h3>              <span>Price: from <strong>£450</strong></span>            </div>            <a href="#" class="btn-primary">              <span>Enquire now</span>            </a>          </div>          <div class="treatments-content__body">            <ul>              <li>                <h4>What is it?</h4>                <p>                  Internal bleaching is a way of restoring a discoloured tooth's original                  appearance that is often combined with crowning or bonding the tooth surface                  in order to mask discolouration.                </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Who is it for?</h4>                <p>                  We are happy to discuss this cosmetic procedure with anyone who is                  concerned about the colour of one or more of their teeth.                                                                                                     </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>How does it work?</h4>                <p>                  Internal bleaching is the process of bleaching or whitening a tooth from the                  inside out.

The goal of orthodontics is to                  properly align the teeth, which may not be possible if the teeth are too big or                  too numerous for the mouth.                                                                                                                     </p>                <p>                  Other instances in which we perform an extraction include severe infection                  that will not be remedied by root canal therapy; periodontal gum disease; and                  cases when people who have a compromised immune system – such as cancer                  patients – have an infected tooth and have been advised to remove it as a                  matter of urgency.                                  </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>How does it work?</h4>                <p>                  Before pulling the tooth, we will give you an injection of a local anaesthetic to                  numb the area where the tooth will be removed. If the tooth is impacted, we                  will cut away gum and bone tissue that covers the tooth and then, using                  forceps, grasp the tooth and gently rock it back and forth to loosen it from the                  jaw bone and ligaments that hold it in place. Sometimes, a hard-to-pull tooth                  must be removed in pieces.                                  </p>              </li>              <li>                <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>                <p>                  There is little point in dressing up the fact that tooth extraction is one of the                  more demanding dental procedures in terms of the patient experience, though                  before pulling the tooth we will give you an injection of a local anaesthetic to                  numb the area where the tooth will be removed.                </p>                <p>                  Our aim is always to ensure the comfort of the patient as best as our skills and                  the latest technology allow. In some instances, we may suggest intravenous                  sedation.                </p>              </li>            </ul>            <div class="treatments-content__image">              <picture><source srcset="img/treatments/treatments-2.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/treatments/treatments-2.png" alt="Treatments preview"></picture>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </div></section>      <!-- Contacts form -->      <section id="contacts-form" class="contacts-form">  <div class="container">    <div class="section-header">      <h2>Contacts us</h2>      <a href="refering.html" class="btn-secondary">        Refering dentist?      </a>    </div>    <form action="" class="form">      <input type="text" name="" id="" class="form__field" placeholder="Name" required><input type="tel" name="" id="" class="form__field" placeholder="Phone" required><input type="email" name="" id="" class="form__field" placeholder="Email" required>      <select id="mounth">        <option value="hide">Dental issue</option>        <option value="root canal treatment">Root canal treatment</option>        <option value="tooth infection">Tooth infection</option>        <option value="toothache">Toothache</option>        <option value="lost filling">Lost filling</option>        <option value="lost crown">Lost crown</option>        <option value="bleaching">Bleaching</option>        <option value="broken tooth">Broken tooth</option>        <option value="other">Other</option>      </select>      <textarea name="" id="" rows="1" class="form__field message" placeholder="Message"></textarea>      <button type="submit" class="btn-primary">        Send      </button>    </form>  </div></section>    </main>      <!-- Footer -->    <footer class="footer">  <div class="container">    <div class="footer__row">      <a href="index.html" class="logo">        <picture><source srcset="img/logo.svg" type="image/webp"><img src="img/logo.svg" alt="Logo of Endoclinic"></picture>      </a>      <ul class="footer__list">        <li>          <a href="treatments.html">            Treatments          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="technology.html">            Technology          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="about.html">            About us          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="contact.html">            Contact          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="Locations.html">            Locations          </a>        </li>      </ul>    </div>    <ul>      <li>        <h3>Phone</h3>        <a href="tel:+447700900652">          +44 7700 900652        </a>      </li>      <li>        <h3>Email</h3>        <a href="mailto:jassareljabouri@me.com">          jassareljabouri@me.com        </a>      </li>      <li>        <h3>Location</h3>        <a href="#">          57 Markham Street          SW3 3NR London        </a>      </li>    </ul>    <div class="copyright">      <a href="#">        Terms and Conditions      </a>      <a href="privacy-policy.html">        Privacy Policy      </a>    </div>  </div></footer>  </div>  <!-- Import Script's -->  <script src="./js/vendor.min.js"></script>  <script src="./js/main.js"></script></body></html>
