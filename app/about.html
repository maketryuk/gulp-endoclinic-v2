Referrals only tell part of the story, however. When a patient has been diagnosed with a dental disease or has been told of a specific treatment option that would be of benefit to them, they are free to pursue the expert of their choosing for the work they need.        </p>        <p>          This path often leads to Dr El Jabouri – especially if the patient is seeking root canal therapy. As a vastly experienced dentist in this field with a strong commitment to patient care (and also to using the latest technology that the profession has to offer), Dr El Jabouri appeals to many such patients – people who want the very best treatment available anywhere in the UK and are determined to put their dental care in the safest possible hands.        </p>        <p>          In a career spanning almost 20 years, Dr El Jabouri has undertaken more than 7,500 root canal treatments, most of the time performing the surgery through the lens of a highly-specialised microscope – his current choice is a state-of-the-art Carl Zeiss microscope, widely recognised as the finest instrument in its field. It enables him to find – and treat – root canals narrower than a human hair.        </p>        <p>          His other areas of expertise include restorative dentistry, metal-free crowns and internal bleaching (a process to whiten the teeth from the inside out), and he is regularly consulted by other dentists on matters relating to pain diagnostics, the prognosis of teeth with disease, dental radiology and the diagnosis of soft and hard tissue anomalies.        </p>        <p>          During the last two decades, Dr El Jabouri has been employed as Head of Department and lecturer at the Dental Nursing Academy; as Principal Dentist and Clinical Director at the eight-practice MMC Dental Group; and as Clinical Director at MyHealthcare Clinic – in addition to several other appointments. He has also mentored and coached more than 50 dentists and accepted patients from more than 120 referring dentists.        </p>        <p>          Today, Dr El Jabouri consults at five highly-respected private dental clinics across the south of England; collectively, these are the setting for The Endodontic Clinic, and are where Dr El Jabouri and his team look after patients who want the very best treatment available.        </p>        <p>          All of these clinics are luxuriously appointed, widely-acclaimed and offer a patient experience that is second to none. Each, in fact, was hand-picked by Dr El-Jabouri for its class-leading facilities.        </p>        <p>          As these clinics cast a wide net over London and the surrounding areas, they put Dr El Jabouri's exceptional skills and knowledge within reach of a wide body of people who are determined to seek out the best possible treatment for their teeth when they need expert help.        </p>        <p>          If you'd like to know more about how Dr El Jabouri and the Endodontic Clinic can help with your dental issue, please fill out the enquiry form.        </p>        <p>          Dr El Jabouri is a member of both the British Endodontic Society and The American Association of Endodontists.        </p>        <div class="about-progress-table">          <div class="about-progress-wrapper">            <div class="about-progress__item">              <picture><source srcset="img/about/about-progress-1.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/about/about-progress-1.png" alt="About Progress"></picture>            </div>          </div>          <div class="about-progress-wrapper">            <div class="about-progress__item">              <picture><source srcset="img/about/about-progress-2.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/about/about-progress-2.png" alt="About Progress"></picture>            </div>          </div>        </div>        <div class="about-quote">          <i class="icon-quotes"></i>          <p>            The dental profession holds a special position of trust within society – so it is our duty to examine, inform, recommend and treat patients with the utmost integrity.          </p>          <h3>            Dr Jassar El Jabouri            <span>Founder, The Endodontic Clinic</span>          </h3>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </div></section>      <!-- Contacts form -->      <section id="contacts-form" class="contacts-form" role="form">  <div class="container">    <div class="section-header">      <h2>Contacts us</h2>      <a href="refering.html" class="btn-secondary">        Refering dentist?      </a>    </div>    <form action="" class="form">      <input type="text" name="user_name" id="" class="form__field" placeholder="Name" ><input type="tel" name="user_phone" id="" class="form__field" placeholder="Phone" ><input type="email" name="user_email" id="" class="form__field" placeholder="Email" >      <select id="mounth">        <option value="hide">Dental issue</option>        <option value="root canal treatment">Root canal treatment</option>        <option value="tooth infection">Tooth infection</option>        <option value="toothache">Toothache</option>        <option value="lost filling">Lost filling</option>        <option value="lost crown">Lost crown</option>        <option value="bleaching">Bleaching</option>        <option value="broken tooth">Broken tooth</option>        <option value="other">Other</option>      </select>      <textarea name="" id="" rows="1" class="form__field message" placeholder="Message"></textarea>      <button type="submit" class="btn-primary">        Send      </button>    </form>  </div></section>    </main>      <!-- Footer -->    <footer class="footer">  <div class="container">    <div class="footer__row">      <a href="index.html" class="logo">        <picture><source srcset="img/logo.svg" type="image/webp"><img src="img/logo.svg" alt="Logo of Endoclinic"></picture>      </a>      <ul class="footer__list">        <li>          <a href="treatments.html">            Treatments          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="technology.html">            Technology          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="about.html">            About us          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="contact.html">            Contact          </a>        </li>        <li>          <a href="Locations.html">            Locations          </a>        </li>      </ul>    </div>    <ul>      <li>        <h3>Phone</h3>        <a href="tel:+447700900652">          +44 7700 900652        </a>      </li>      <li>        <h3>Email</h3>        <a href="mailto:jassareljabouri@me.com">          jassareljabouri@me.com        </a>      </li>      <li>        <h3>Location</h3>        <a href="#">          57 Markham Street          SW3 3NR London        </a>      </li>    </ul>    <div class="copyright">      <a href="#">        Terms and Conditions      </a>      <a href="privacy-policy.html">        Privacy Policy      </a>    </div>  </div></footer>  </div>  <!-- Import Script's -->  <script src="./js/vendor.min.js"></script>  <script src="./js/main.js"></script></body></html>
