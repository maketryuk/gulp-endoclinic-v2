            <div class="technology-card__body">
              <p>
                The better your dentist can see what he is working with, the higher the chances of a successful diagnosis and treatment. By using Cone Beam CT (CBCT) scanners, we are able to take an image of the inside of a tooth as well as the area surrounding it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Studies have shown that up to 40 per cent of abscesses cannot be seen on a traditional 2D x-ray, an imaging method that can also lead to disappointing results when trying to identify fractures and root canal anatomy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CBCT scanner is central to the way in which we practice at The Endodontic Clinic, and provides us with unrivalled reliability when it comes to diagnosis and subsequent treatment planning. Our expertise in this relatively new and effective diagnostic modality has resulted in the practice becoming referral centres for complex cases many times.

              <p>
                All of the files used by The Endodontic Clinic have been carefully selected for
                their reliability and high-quality. We only use the best, as this helps us to
                increase the predictability of treatment results. They give us consistency in the
                root canal therapy process and control over the different aspects that influence
                root canal therapy.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of our root canal treatments are performed with Nickel-Titanium file
                systems that have been metallurgically enhanced through heat treatment
                technology. For each patient, we select the file system that is best suited to the
                anatomical dimensions of the tooth, and we have three industry-leading
                brands to choose from.
              </p>
              <p>
                As every root treatment is unique, part of the planning process involves the
                endodontic clinician making key decisions about the choice of files well in
                advance of the procedure.

              <h3>3D Root Filling</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="technology-card__body">
              <p>
                Root canal treatments are among the most difficult procedures carried out in
                general dental practice, and we are very lucky to have access to the latest
                technology to take on the most complex root canal treatment cases.
                Through the use of the Warm Vertical Condensation technique and the Vertical
                Hydraulic Condensation technique, we can ensure that the most challenging
                root canal anatomies are filled without leaving any voids for bacteria to get
                back into the canals. Once the area is thoroughly cleansed, we can begin
                sealing the affected area.
              </p>
              <p>
                At The Endodontic Clinic, we have banned conventional Epoxy-resin based
                sealers which were known to shrink and create tiny spaces between the root fill
                material and the canal walls. The bioceramic sealers used by The Endodontic Clinic:
                <span>- Do not shrink – instead they expand by 0.2%</span>
                <span>- Are highly biocompatible (friendly to the body)</span>
                <span>- Produce hydroxyapatite (a natural mineral present in dentin and enamel)</span>
                <span>- Are highly antimicrobial</span>
                <span>- Create a chemical bond with the tooth and provide a seamless seal</span>
                The materials we use are designed to last a lifetime: this helps us to greatly
                reduce the risk of re-infection and the need for retreatments or tooth
                extractions.

            </div>
            <div class="technology-card__body">
              <p>
                At The Endodontic Clinic, we use sonic and ultrasonic devices to activate the
                disinfecting solution which is added to the tooth during root canal therapy.
                The tips of these highly-specialised devices (which differ considerably from at-
                home versions) vibrate at speeds of 360,000 oscillations per minute. The result
                is a three-dimensional movement that triggers cavitation – a process by which
                bubbles formed from the action of the polyamide tip become unstable,
                collapse, and cause a vacuum-like ‘implosion.’
                This creates a micro cyclone inside the root canal, and thanks to this incredible
                technological advancement we can now clean canals with much higher levels of
                accuracy than ever before.

              <p>
                It is often said in medicine that if you cannot see it, you cannot treat it. We can
                find root canals narrower than a human hair with our advanced magnification
                systems – and that means we can treat them, too.
                At The Endodontic Clinic, we use both dental loupe and microscope
                magnification. Orascoptic loupes are the leading source of magnification for
                endodontic practitioners: the XV1 model that we use has the option of x3, x4
                and x5 magnification and its Konica lens provides crystal clear vision that makes
                it well-suited to root canal treatments, crown preparation and endodontic
                diagnostics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our preferred microscope is the extremely sophisticated Carl Zeiss microscope
                – widely recognised as the finest instrument of its type and very much a key
                component in the treatments that we undertake at The Endodontic Clinic. The
                same microscope is also used in micro-vascular and neurosurgery, and without
                it, complex root canal treatment delivered at the highest levels would not be
                possible. The intensity of its Xenon light is brighter than looking into the sun.
                The right combination of loupes and the endodontic microscope gives us the
                ability to refine the level of precision involved in the ever demanding and
                technical field of root canal therapy, and deliver world-class results.

                Pulp cells – soft tissue comprised of blood vessels, neural fibers and connective
                tissue in the root of the tooth – continue to create dentin (the fabric of the
                tooth beneath the exterior enamel) over time. In some cases, this can result in
                root canals becoming constricted.When this happens, a new revolutionary technique can be used to locate the
                most inaccessible canals and treat them. Canals that open up in the deepest
                sections of the root canal system can be located using a computer-guided root
                canal therapy process which makes it possible to view the overall anatomy of
                the jaw, teeth, root canal system and surrounding tissues. This helps us to
                know exactly where the root canals are located before starting treatment.                                
              </p>
              <p>
                The step-by-step process of root canal therapy using the computer-guided
                workflow is as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall scan of the jaw area: with the help of the most sophisticated
                CBCT scanner, we are able to generate an accurate three-dimensional
                image of the jaw area including the exact teeth positions, dental
                restorations, shape and location of the root canal system, bone quality
                and quantity, nerve tissues and any sinus cavities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creation of 3D model: once we have this detailed information, with the
                help of highly specialised software we are able to create a 3D model of
                the jaw so we can ‘virtually’ gain access to the root canal system through
                the optimum pathway.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drilling guide is prepared: The 3D model showing the virtual placement
                and correct angulation of the drill is then sent to a specialised laboratory
                to prepare the precise drilling guide using 3D printing. This is then used
                during the root canal treatment.
