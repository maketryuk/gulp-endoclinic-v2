        <h2>Dr. El Jabouri</h2>
        <p>
          The Endodontic Clinic was founded by Dr Jassar El Jabouri, a highly sought-after endodontics surgeon who is committed to excellence within this specialised field of dentistry. 
        </p>

          During his career, Dr El Jabouri has performed more than 7,500 endodontic treatments using orascoptic loupes and/or microscope – he currently uses a state-of-the-art <strong>Carl Zeiss microscope</strong>, widely recognised as the finest instrument of its kind.
