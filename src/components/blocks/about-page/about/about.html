        <h2>Dr. El Jabouri</h2>
        <p>
          A well-known fact within the medical profession that members of the public sometimes aren't aware of is that practitioners who have a highly-specialised skill often work across multiple clinics.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a rule, the more niche and finely-honed a practitioner's area of expertise, the narrower his or her audience – so people who are especially proficient within a given field tend to cover quite a wide area.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, Dr Jassar El Jabouri – a leading expert in the field of root canal therapy – established The Endodontic Clinic across a network of elite dental clinics throughout the south of England.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr El Jabouri is typically called on by resident dentists when a patient is in need of complex dental work that is not readily available in-house. Referrals only tell part of the story, however. When a patient has been diagnosed with a dental disease or has been told of a specific treatment option that would be of benefit to them, they are free to pursue the expert of their choosing for the work they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          This path often leads to Dr El Jabouri – especially if the patient is seeking root canal therapy. As a vastly experienced dentist in this field with a strong commitment to patient care (and also to using the latest technology that the profession has to offer), Dr El Jabouri appeals to many such patients – people who want the very best treatment available anywhere in the UK and are determined to put their dental care in the safest possible hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a career spanning almost 20 years, Dr El Jabouri has undertaken more than 7,500 root canal treatments, most of the time performing the surgery through the lens of a highly-specialised microscope – his current choice is a state-of-the-art Carl Zeiss microscope, widely recognised as the finest instrument in its field. It enables him to find – and treat – root canals narrower than a human hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          His other areas of expertise include restorative dentistry, metal-free crowns and internal bleaching (a process to whiten the teeth from the inside out), and he is regularly consulted by other dentists on matters relating to pain diagnostics, the prognosis of teeth with disease, dental radiology and the diagnosis of soft and hard tissue anomalies.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last two decades, Dr El Jabouri has been employed as Head of Department and lecturer at the Dental Nursing Academy; as Principal Dentist and Clinical Director at the eight-practice MMC Dental Group; and as Clinical Director at MyHealthcare Clinic – in addition to several other appointments. He has also mentored and coached more than 50 dentists and accepted patients from more than 120 referring dentists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Dr El Jabouri consults at five highly-respected private dental clinics across the south of England; collectively, these are the setting for The Endodontic Clinic, and are where Dr El Jabouri and his team look after patients who want the very best treatment available.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these clinics are luxuriously appointed, widely-acclaimed and offer a patient experience that is second to none. Each, in fact, was hand-picked by Dr El-Jabouri for its class-leading facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As these clinics cast a wide net over London and the surrounding areas, they put Dr El Jabouri's exceptional skills and knowledge within reach of a wide body of people who are determined to seek out the best possible treatment for their teeth when they need expert help.
