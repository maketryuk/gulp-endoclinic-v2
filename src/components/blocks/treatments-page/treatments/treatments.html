                <p class="site-description">
                  Root canal treatment/therapy is a specialised dental procedure performed by a highly-skilled expert that can be used to save a tooth with a damaged root that is badly decayed, cracked, or has become very painful/infected.
                </p>
                <p class="site-description">
                  During the procedure, the pulp (tooth nerve) is removed from inside the tooth, and the area it vacates is then meticulously cleaned and sealed. Endodontics is the medical term for the field of dentistry that deals with root canal therapy and diseases of the dental pulp.

                  Some of the common symptoms of an infected pulp include persistent pain, swollen o tnder gums, sensitivity to heat/cold, tooth discolouration and pain when you touch the tooth.

                  However, pulp-related issues will not be the cause in every case, which is why you should visit your local dentist before contacting us as they may diagnose a more minor problem that can be treated there and then.

                  Teeth have several layers: the outermost layer is composed of a hard substance known as enamel. Beneath this is an inner layer called dentin, which has a soft tissue known as pulp at its centre. This pulp contains blood vessels, nerves and the connective tissue that helps to form the dentin and enamel during tooth development.

                  A second opinion report from The Endodontic Clinic offers reassurance to those
                  who are not satisfied with a diagnosis from their current dentist. All dentists
                  have unique backgrounds and even variations in training – a different, expert
                  perspective can help you to make an informed decision about your treatment
                  options. There are other instances in which a second opinion report may be
                  required, as detailed below.

                  Any individual who is worried about the level of care they are getting from
                  their existing dentist, or who has just completed an expensive or complicated
                  treatment elsewhere and is unhappy with the end result.
                  Our second opinion reports can also be of benefit to those who are worried
                  about a hospital or NHS referral that is taking too long; people who have had
                  an accident and need to make a claim; those who need a dental report because
                  of their job (for example, if they are working overseas for an extended period);
                  and those who are simply 'shopping around' and want to get an idea of what a
                  detailed treatment plan would look like and cost.
                  Another reason someone might want to seek a second opinion is if they have
                  been told by their dentist that they need to see a dental specialist in a specific
                  field; the Endodontic Clinic team will be able to advise the best course of
                  action.

                  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) scans are a way for a dentist to get a vivid 3D image of
                  the intricacies of a patient’s teeth and gums without having to undertake
                  exploratory/invasive treatment procedures to try and ascertain what lies
                  “beneath the surface”.

                  They are a state-of-the-art alternative to more traditional intra-oral x-rays,
                  which show a two-dimensional image as opposed to the three-dimensional
                  image created by a CBCT scan.

                  A CBCT scan is an excellent, state-of-the art diagnostic tool that is well-suited to
                  patients whose dental issue is not clear-cut. Much of what happens to a tooth
                  is going on beneath the surface, and while skilled experts can often
                  hypothesize with a great degree of skill about a patient’s dental issue, a CBCT
                  scan removes all of the guesswork. CBCT scans are very often used during
                  endodontics to ensure that root canal treatment is indeed required.

                  The team at The Endodontic Clinic are highly proficient in this relatively new
                  way of diagnosing dental conditions, and are able to pinpoint the scan down to
                  a very specific part of the mouth – thus limiting radiation to an incredibly small
                  area.

                <p class="site-description">
                  The CBCT machine is similar to the CT scanner seen in hospitals, only much
                  more compact. The 3D image it creates provides vital insight into the insides of
                  the tooth and the area surrounding it, and can help identify tiny fractures,
                  missed canal anatomy, diseases of the jaw and more.

                  Sedation is the ultimate solution for anxious patients – or those who have been
                  putting off dental work for fear that it will be painful. Did you know that almost
                  22 per cent of people skip their dental appointments because of fear?
                  Thankfully, modern dentistry provides the answer in the form of IV sedation
                  dentistry, which offers patients the chance to greatly reduce the stress that
                  they may otherwise fear. It is a form of conscious sedation that does not put
                  you fully to sleep, but it does make you relaxed and much less aware of your
                  surroundings. It is also noted for its pain-reduction qualities, too.

                  Sedation can be a godsend for people in need of restorative dental work who
                  have been avoiding making an appointment because they fear the dentist. It
                  provides a way for a patient to become far less aware of – and concerned by –
                  their surroundings while treatment is being undertaken.
                  It is fast-acting, and, when coupled with local anaesthetic, ensures that as little
                  discomfort as possible is experienced during the procedure.

                <p class="site-description">
                  IV sedation is not readily available at all dental clinics and requires dedicated
                  sedationists who have extensive clinical experience in the treatment of anxious
                  patients. Those who work with The Endodontic Clinic are highly skilled and will
                  hand-hold patients through every step of their treatment.

                <p class="site-description">
                  No, though there will be a small pin-prick when the IV needle is applied. What
                  may be very appealing to some is that dental sedation creates a period of
                  amnesia, so you won't remember the procedure when you wake up.
                  It can also be beneficial when multiple procedures are needed: when patients
                  are relaxed and not experiencing any discomfort, they are more easily able to
                  sit for longer spells in the dentist's chair, with the result that several visits may
                  be condensed into one.

                  Unlike metal crowns of the past, the all-ceramic crowns used by The
                  Endodontic Clinic are crafted using layers of porcelain that not only protect the
                  remaining tooth structure, but look more realistic than past restorations.
                  Metal-free crowns are the premium option for restoring a damaged tooth.

                  Metal-free crowns are the most desirable solution for people who are looking
                  for the most aesthetically-pleasing solution to a damaged tooth. Patients may
                  either be referred to us by their dentist, or can contact us directly if they know
                  they need a crown and would like to enjoy the unrivalled level of service and
                  expertise that The Endodontic Clinic offers. Most commonly, however, we fit
                  crowns as the final part of root canal treatment.

                <p class="site-description">
                  We first remove the damaged/decaying part of the tooth in question and then
                  build up layers onto that area using porcelain Emax or Zirconia – two extremely
                  strong substances that give people a newfound confidence in their ability to
                  bite into things that has often been missing for some time.

                  The end result is designed to mirror the look of the original tooth as closely as
                  possible – and as the material used is semi-translucent (as is the case with
                  natural teeth), the effect is very convincing.

                  Having a metal-free crown fitted is much the same as having a filling, and we
                  will ensure that discomfort is kept to a minimum by using local anaesthetic,
                  which numbs both the tooth and the surrounding gum area.

                  When decay affects a tooth at a comparatively superficial level – i.e. root canal
                  treatment is not required – a dentist will often recommend a filling. Technology
                  has moved on somewhat since the 1970s and 80s when metal fillings were
                  widely used; today's dentist has other options, and The Endodontic Clinic only
                  fits white composite fillings, not least because these are aesthetically-pleasing.

                <p class="site-description">
                  White composite fillings are a solution to tooth decay and cavities for patients
                  of all ages. The quality of the filling material is second to none and is long-
                  lasting, hard-wearing and virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the tooth.

                  With the affected area having first been treated with anaesthetic to numb it,
                  we next use a diamond-coated drill to remove the decayed area. At The
                  Endodontic Clinic, we have many years of experience in extracting the decayed
                  tissue from teeth and will painstakingly ensure that all the affected area – and
                  no more – is removed.

                <p class="site-description">
                  The space left behind is then prepared for filling by thoroughly cleansing the
                  cavity to ensure no debris or bacteria remains, before a composite resin in a
                  hue designed to match the existing tooth is added. The final step is to polish
                  the filling.

                  Fillings perhaps represent the stereotypical 'worst nightmare' in terms of a visit
                  to the dentists, often because of unpleasant experiences people had of having
                  fillings when they were a child.
                  Fortunately, today's technology both in terms of anaesthetics and methods for
                  the removal of decayed material render these historic impressions something
                  of a myth. At the Endodontic Clinic, you will be welcomed in a luxurious,

                  Most of the time, root canal treatment undertaken by an expert will result in a
                  saved tooth that will last a lifetime – but this isn’t always the case.
                  Sometimes, the procedure hasn’t been performed to the exacting standards
                  that this kind of therapy requires; in other cases the tooth simply hasn’t healed

                  During retreatment, we will reopen the tooth and remove the old filling
                  materials that were placed in the root canals during the first procedure. We
                  then carefully examine the tooth, looking for additional canals or new areas of
                  infection.

                  We will then remove any infection, disinfect, and shape the canals using
                  ultrasonic powered irrigation techniques, before adding new filling materials.
                  The opening is then sealed with a temporary filling. Once the tooth heals, a
                  new crown or other restoration is placed on the tooth to protect it.

                  When a tooth is decayed, bacteria can spread through the dental pulp (nerve
                  tissues) in the root of the tooth and cause further complications. The aim of
                  vital pulp therapy – also known as a pulpotomy – is to extract any infected pulp
                  and safeguard the remainder.

                  Vital pulp therapy may be appropriate when full root canal treatment is not
                  required: it is a slightly less involved/invasive procedure and therefore both
                  easier to perform and more affordable.

                  materials (BC RRM putty) for this, because clinical research has shown very

                  Composite restorations are versatile tooth-coloured filling materials composed
                  of strong polymer and glass particles that are used at The Endodontic Clinic to
                  fill cavities and restore extensively broken down teeth.

                  At The Endodontic Clinic we have been practising mercury-free dentistry and
                  endodontics for the past two decades: Dr El Jabouri has, in fact, never placed a
                  single amalgam (metal) filling in his entire career. He and the rest of The
                  Endodontic Clinic team would recommend composite restorations over
                  amalgam fillings to anyone.

                <p class="site-description">
                  The filling materials are carefully applied to the tooth where needed and help
                  to return it back to health. After the procedure, the tooth should function just
                  as it did before decay set in, and will also be aesthetically in keeping with the
                  rest of the teeth.

                  We should point out that composite restorations may also be used as a less
                  invasive alternative to more traditional crowns, inlays and onlays which require
                  more extensive preparation. They can also be used to make cosmetic changes
                  to teeth – teeth deemed to be too small, for example.

                  Regenerative endodontics is an emerging field in which Dr El Jabouri at The
                  Endodontic Clinic is something of a pioneer. In simple terms, it allows us to try
                  and revitalise or regenerate an immature tooth's natural tissue so that the root
                  can continue to grow.

                  This is in contrast to the more traditional option in instances of a tooth with
                  root damage, which would be to harden the root end and close the canal.
                  While this solves the issue, it does mean that the tooth's root will not continue
                  to develop.

                  Regenerative endodontics uses the concept of tissue engineering to restore the
                  pulp and root canals to a healthy state. Though tissue regeneration is still in its
                  infancy, studies suggest that “dead,” immature teeth are capable of
                  regenerating pulp-like tissues that foster root development.

                  The treatment is similar to root canal therapy and we can give local
                  anaesthetic. The tissue regeneration itself actually occurs after the treatment
                  has been completed.

                  Internal bleaching is a way of restoring a discoloured tooth's original
                  appearance that is often combined with crowning or bonding the tooth surface

                  Internal bleaching is the process of bleaching or whitening a tooth from the
                  inside out. Unlike traditional tooth whitening, where whitening agents are
                  applied to the outside of the tooth, internal bleaching is completed from the
                  inside out. In cases of trauma or cavities, the discoloration begins from inside
                  of the tooth and then spreads outwards.

                  Extraction is, as the word suggests, the extraction of a tooth or teeth, and can
                  be pursued for a variety of reasons.
                  As well as being an expert in root canal therapy, Dr El Jabouri at The
                  Endodontic Clinic has performed many thousands of extractions and is able to
                  advise on the removal of teeth when this is either desirable – such as with
                  wisdom teeth as soon as they erupt – or essential, as is sometimes the case
                  after severe infection.

                <p class="site-description">
                  The Endodontic Clinic sometimes extracts teeth because the mouth has
                  become too crowded and the removal of one or more teeth has been
                  recommended by a specialist orthodontist. The goal of orthodontics is to
                  properly align the teeth, which may not be possible if the teeth are too big or
                  too numerous for the mouth.

                <p class="site-description">
                  Other instances in which we perform an extraction include severe infection
                  that will not be remedied by root canal therapy; periodontal gum disease; and
                  cases when people who have a compromised immune system – such as cancer
                  patients – have an infected tooth and have been advised to remove it as a
                  matter of urgency.

                <p class="site-description">
                  Before pulling the tooth, we will give you an injection of a local anaesthetic to
                  numb the area where the tooth will be removed. If the tooth is impacted, we
                  will cut away gum and bone tissue that covers the tooth and then, using
                  forceps, grasp the tooth and gently rock it back and forth to loosen it from the
                  jaw bone and ligaments that hold it in place. Sometimes, a hard-to-pull tooth
                  must be removed in pieces.

                  There is little point in dressing up the fact that tooth extraction is one of the
                  more demanding dental procedures in terms of the patient experience, though
                  before pulling the tooth we will give you an injection of a local anaesthetic to
                  numb the area where the tooth will be removed.
